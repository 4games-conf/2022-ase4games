<!-- ### Second International Workshop on Automated Software Engineering for Computer Games -->

A one day workshop held in conjunction with the [37th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2022).

The goals of **ASE4Games** are gathering academic game researchers and commercial game developers and contributing on topics relevant to the emerging and current challenges in Automated Software Engineering for Games. We seek to:

> Bring together the community of software engineers and game engineers in an interactive program that encourages discussion and scholarly debate from interdisciplinary perspectives.

> Identify and explore emerging and new research challenges, costs and benefits for entertainment games, serious games, and gamification in traditional (non-game) applications and activities.

> Generate a new research agenda, identify topics of interest for this community, and how future workshops may explore these topics.

This workshop is structured to be highly interactive, encourage discussion, and appeal to participants from academia and industry. The workshop will feature keynote presentations, short and long paper presentations with discussions, and a social event to build strong, lasting relationships among the participants.

<!-- The game community continues to grow and embraces stake-holders with broad interests. There are games for entertainment, serious games (i.e., games with a purpose), and gamified applications. Entertainment games, for example, are a thriving industry with over two billion players around the world; this industry generates over 120 billion in revenues. However, todayâ€™s large-scale entertainment games have many challenging development issues. They are complex, can take years to develop, and rely on teams with expertise spanning artistic, computer science, software engineering, and business skills. Games have demanding traditional quality of service requirements (e.g., performance, reliability, scalability, usability). They also have distinct user experience requirements to provide players with a game that is engaging and fun.

The interdisciplinary games and software engineering research community investigates game development issues from the perspectives of traditional engineering (e.g., requirements engineering, design, testing) and umbrella (e.g., lifecycle processes, configuration management, traceability) activities. In addition, topics including metrics, re-use, data analytics, user experience, and so on are also explored. Automating the methods for these diverse topics is essential to support the rapid, cost effective development of high quality games. ASE4Games 2021 provides a forum to explore issues that crosscut the automated software engineering and the game development communities. -->
